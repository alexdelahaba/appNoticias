# News App SPA üöÄ

This repository is part of a set of exercises that I have done in the context of Fernando Herrera's Advanced Angular courses.
This is a PWA for news. It has several pages made with the Ionic v5 model, all loaded with Lazy Loading. It allows you to save news as a favorite and consult it by filtering it by topic.

### Installation üîß
To be able to use the application you have to clone the repository to local and to run it:
* npm install
* ng serve

## Build with üõ†Ô∏è

* Ionic v5 
* Angular 9
* RXJS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Typescript
